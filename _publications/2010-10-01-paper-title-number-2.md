### Abstract
Objective: Using bioinformatics methods to find key genes related to asthma and discussing their molecular mechanisms.
Methods: Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed on GSE143303 microarray dataset to screen out the modules significantly related to asthma. Module genes were subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis and function and pathway enrichment analysis. Key genes were obtained by intersecting WGCNA analysis results with differentially expressed genes. miRDB and miRwalk databases were used to predict upstream miRNAs of key genes, and Cytoscape was used to construct key mRNA-miRNA regulatory network. GSE147878 dataset was used to verify expressions of key genes, and evaluate diagnostic value of key genes according to ROC curve.
Results: Genes in magenta module and purple module were significantly related to asthma, mainly involved in Wnt signaling pathway, cell adhesion and so on. A total of 13 key genes were obtained, including ATP6V1G1, TXNDC17, NDUFA4, RHOA, SEC61B, RPS3A, PSMC5, GSPT1, MBP, SMARCC2, GNL3L, RPL7L1, RAD21 and their potential miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks.
Conclusion: Key genes such as ATP6V1G1, GSPT1, SEC61B play an important role in bronchial asthma and have clinical diagnostic value.
