I am a Ph.D. candidate in Internal Medicine at Peking University. My research primarily focuses on the pathogenesis and treatment of autoimmune kidney diseases, artificial intelligence and multi-omics data analysis, as well as the mechanisms underlying the health hazards induced by environmental pollutants.
