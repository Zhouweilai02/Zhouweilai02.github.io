I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Internal Medicine at Peking University First Hospital. My research focuses primarily on the pathogenesis and treatment of autoimmune kidney diseases. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in Clinical Medicine, during which I was mainly engaged in research on the environmental risks and health effects of pollutants.
